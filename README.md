Guess the Number Game
This is a simple guessing game where the user tries to guess a random number between 1 and 10.

Getting Started
To run the game, simply run the main.py file. The game will prompt the user to enter a number between 1 and 10 until they guess the correct number.

To run the unit tests, run the test_main.py file. The tests cover the run_guess function, which validates user input and returns a boolean value indicating whether the guess was correct or not.
